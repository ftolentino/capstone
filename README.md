* Three.js
* Three Fiber


### Research & Planning Log
#### Friday, 09/16/2022
* 8:30: create github repository
* 8:40: research Three.js and React Three Fiber docs
* 9:30: initialize proj to github
* 9:30 - 11:00: research example projects, scrub YT for examples
* 11:00 - 12:00: watch a couple different YT videos, bookmarking the ones I found useful to a playlist
* 1:00p - 3:00p: watch select videos that interested me the most
* 3:30p - 4:00p: capstone proposal
* 4:00p - 5:00p: following suggested links on the docs and start to implement sample code

#### Friday, 09/23/2022
* 8:30: reading through different documentation to find a starting point to work off of
* 9:30 - 10:30: follow along with Three.js fundamental tutorial to set up a scene
* 10:30 - 11:30: trouble shooting, debug, tutorial setup
* 12:30 - 1:00: learned how to set up my first 3D scene with an working camera to orbit around a 3D mesh.
* 2:00 - 3:00: research, scrubbing documentation

## Intructions
* Rotate the sphere by moving your mouse left or right
* Rotate the particle system by moving your mouse up or down
* Zoom in and out by scrolling your mouse wheel or holding middle mouse button and moving your mouse back and forth
* Pan around the scene by holding right click and moving your mouse around

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev
